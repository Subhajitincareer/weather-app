## Overview

This Weather App allows users to choose from a predefined list of cities and view the current weather conditions, including temperature, sunrise time, wind speed, minimum and maximum temperatures, air quality index (AQI), and weather alerts. It features a clean and intuitive design built with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- City selection via a dropdown menu  
- Displays current temperature with an icon representation  
- Shows weather conditions such as "Rain Shower," "Clear Sky," etc.  
- Sunrise time and wind speed displayed with labels  
- Min and max temperature for the day  
- Air Quality Index with descriptive labels (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)  
- Weather alerts if available from the API  
- Responsive and modern UI powered by Tailwind CSS  
- Accessible with proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML  

## Demo

*Add link or screenshots here if available.*

## Technologies

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) - Weather, Air Quality, and Alerts  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Utility-first CSS framework  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
- HTML5 & CSS3  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- Internet connection for API requests  
- An API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid) (free tier available)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. If you want to modify or build with Tailwind CSS locally, install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Replace the API key in `script.js` with your own:
   ```js
   const API_KEY = "your_openweathermap_api_key";
   ```

4. Serve the app:
   - Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in a browser  
   - Option 2: Use a development server like VSCode Live Server or `http-server`

## Project Structure

```
weather-app/
├── index.html         # Main HTML file for UI
├── styles.css         # CSS styles (if not using CDN)
├── script.js          # JavaScript app logic and API calls
├── cloud.png          # Default weather icon placeholder
├── README.md          # Documentation (this file)
└── assets/            # (Optional) Folder for images and additional assets
```

## Usage

1. Open the app in a browser.  
2. Use the dropdown menu at the top to select a city.  
3. The app automatically fetches the latest weather data, AQI, and alerts for the city.  
4. The data will update to reflect the current information.  
5. If an error occurs (e.g., network issue or incorrect city), an error message and fallback UI will display.

## API Details

- **Current Weather Data**:  
  Fetches temperature, condition, sunrise, wind, min/max temperature from `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`

- **Air Quality Index**:  
  Retrieved from `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/air_pollution`

- **Weather Alerts**:  
  From the One Call API `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall` endpoint, checking the `alerts` array

**Note:** All API calls include your `appid` (API key) and utilize metric units for temperature (°C). The app handles fetch errors gracefully.

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML5 elements (``, ``, ``) are used for structure.  
- ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-live`, `aria-describedby`) ensure the app is screen-reader friendly.  
- Keyboard focus and tab order supported naturally via form controls and buttons.  

## Customization

- Add or remove cities by editing the `` dropdown in `index.html`.  
- Replace `cloud.png` with other weather icon assets or use dynamic icon URLs from the API.  
- Customize fonts, colors, and layout by modifying Tailwind CSS classes or overriding in `styles.css`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your API key is valid and has permissions for the queried endpoints.  
- Check internet connectivity if data does not load.  
- Verify browser console for errors and cross-origin/network issues.  
- Use HTTPS for all API requests to avoid mixed-content warnings.  
- If icons do not load, verify image URLs or replace the default icon.
